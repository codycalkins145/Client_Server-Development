# Client_Server-Development
  How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which     you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD   Python module in the future?
    
    For this project specifically, I ensured that all variables and each function were named
    appropriately according to what they were.  Additionally, I ensured that any variables that
    did need changing, due to being used on another local server or for another dataset, were
    easy to find and change.  In working this way, I can make a program that is useable for
    many different scenarios by many different users, with relatively minor changes.  While
    this project currently only uses this CRUD module for reading data, it could be used for another
    database project that allows users to edit or remove data as they deem necessary.  This CRUD
    module could also be expanded to allow for simple user creation, permissions, and authentication.
  
  How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested.   How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to         create databases to meet other client requests?
  
     Specifically for this project, I ensured that I understood the client's requirements for creating
     a functional database.  This also comes with brainstorming or planning how the project needed to
     be structured and tested.  This approach is similar to the approach I usually take, as I've found
     it to yield the best results in previous and current projects.  I would likely continue to use this
     for any client requests I come across in the future.
     
  What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work   better?
  
     When developing the code, I found reviewing the given UML diagram to be the most helpful aspect
     of the design document. This gave me clear relationships between each class and how each class 
     should function together.
