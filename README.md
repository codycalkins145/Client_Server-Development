# Client_Server-Development
  How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which     you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD   Python module in the future?
    
    For this project specifically, I ensured that all variables and each function were named
    appropriately according to what they were.  Additionally, I ensured that any variables that
    did need changing, due to being used on another local server or for another dataset, were
  
  How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested.   How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to         create databases to meet other client requests?
  
     I'd say I did the best on describing the Domain Model during the development of this 
     documentation. I had a fairly easy time in understanding the structure and the meaning of the 
     UML diagram provided. 
     
  What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work   better?
  
     When developing the code, I found reviewing the given UML diagram to be the most helpful aspect
     of the design document. This gave me clear relationships between each class and how each class 
     should function together.
